# PhysicsSimulator
Code Written By Matthew Markowitz. This is a program where that simulates newtonian physics by allowing the user to fling cubes. These cubes will be affected by forces such as gravity and the initial flinging force. The cubes will bounce of walls of varying bounciness, determined by their color. The goal is to land the cube on the finish wall. A level editor is also included.
